TALK_TITLE = Inside the Regular Expressions in D

LEVEL = Intermediate, Advanced

BENEFITS =
Acquire the knowledge of how regular expressions work from the inside out.
It will greatly aid in furthering the understanding of how to use them
and when
not to use them.  The last but not least it's an opportunity to learn
how to
take advantage of the meta-programming in D.

ABSTRACT =
$(P The talk gives an up-close view of how a regular expression libraries work
behind the scenes, dispelling a few common myths in the process.
The talk consists of two parts with equatorial line being between the
generic and the D specific.)

$(P The first part is intentionally language agnostic and
focuses on the core principles behind the regular expressions.
The key point of this part is the two fundamental ways of
matching regular expression, their respective strengths and weaknesses.)

$(P The second part dives into how all of this fits into std.regex, a modern
regular expression
library written in D. Important practical considerations are discussed,
and some unique
D features that aid such an undertaking are highlighted. Among other
things this
includes an in-depth overview of meta-programming tricks used to
generate optimized
machine code for a regular expression during the compile-time (phew!).)

BIO =
I'm Dmitry Olshansky, a young all-around researcher.
My interests are wildly changing  over the time and include
text processing, compilers, robotics, embedded systems,
parallel and concurrent programming, scalable network systems
and the current pursuit being AI.
Among my works the most publicly recognized today is
the standard regular expression library for D
(a.k.a. $(LINK2 http://dlang.org/phobos/std_regex.html,$(TT std.regex))).
