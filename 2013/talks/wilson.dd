Breaking up is never easy and taking the plunge opens a Pandora’s Box
of difficult questions. This talk will answer some of those questions
and provide direction for anyone looking to convert their C# software
to D. We will focus on the practical issues that anyone converting
their project from C# to D will face. These issues include, but are
not limited to, the differences between C# Namespaces and D Modules,
