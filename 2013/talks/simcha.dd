LEVEL = Intermediate, Advanced

BENEFITS =
Attendees will be exposed to a variety of useful programming
techniques that are obvious only in hindsight.  These will certainly
be useful in D and may even affect their programming style in other
languages where these techniques are less obvious but still possible.

ABSTRACT =
The D programming language offers a variety of abstractions not found
together in any other language.  In particular, D's compile time
metaprogramming facilities are a game changer, especially when
combined with its low-level programming capabilities.  This session
explores design patterns that have emerged from my code, my former
GSoC students' code and code written by other Phobos contributors.  It
attempts to codify some of the more useful patterns that are currently
known only informally and only to a small group of hardcore D users.

BIO =
David Simcha is currently a software engineer at Google's New York
City office, working on scalable nearest neighbor matching.  Previous
to this, he received his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Johns
Hopkins University with a concentration in Bioinformatics while
contributing extensively to D on the side.
