LEVEL = Intermediate

BENEFITS =
$(UL
  $(LI Information about Static Code Analysis for D.)
  $(LI $(LINK2 http://analyzed.no-ip.org/online, DPaste like Web Application.))
  $(LI Extended D toolchain (Styleguard, Metrics, D1to2).)
  $(LI Cleaner Code due to removal of e.g. unused variables.)

ABSTRACT =
$(P Professional Programming in teams requires a common clean coding
style. This could be enforced using code reviews, but the simpler and
less offensive way to achieve this is by using a tool as style cop. It
helps spreading the conventions about the language in the team and
assisting new team members in easily adopt to the programming style by
getting fast feedback on their code. Having such a static code
analyzer refactoring becomes easier, because it reminds about now
unused variables, unused parameters or other refactoring artefacts.)

$(P This talk will introduce you to $(LINK2 http://analyzed.no-ip.org, AnalyzeD),
explain you how it's working, and give you an outline about what's planned.)

$(P AnalyzeD is currently used for checking 250kLOC of production code against $(LINK2 http://analyzed.no-ip.org/conventions, programming conventions) and determines metrics.ent state and what is planned to develop/release.)

BIO =
Stefan Rohe studied computer science in Germany and worked at
Fraunhofer Institute. In 2008 he joined the industry where he got the
chance to redesign a complete server application in D. Now there is a
complete Scrum team of D professionals having about 80% of the code
base emerged to D.
