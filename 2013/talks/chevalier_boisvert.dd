TALK_TITLE = Higgs, an Experimental JIT Compiler written in D

LEVEL = Intermediate

BENEFITS =
An experience report on the usage of D in writing complex systems
software&mdash;a complete JIT compiler including an x86 backend.
Exposure to the world of JIT compilers and dynamic language optimization.
A JIT compiler writer's perspective on the usage of JIT compilation for CTFE.

ABSTRACT =
Just-in-time (JIT) compilers are highly complex pieces of software which
manipulate symbolic representations of code at multiple levels of
abstraction, generate machine instructions, and introspect the state of
programs at execution time. We present an experience report on the usage
of   D in implementing Higgs, an optimizing JIT compiler for JavaScript.
We discuss how various features of D did or did not address our technical
and practical concerns and provide some recommendations for future
development of the language.

BIO =
Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert holds a master's degree from McGill University
and is currently pursuing a PhD at Université de Montréal as part of the
Dynamic Language Team.  Her area of study is compiler design and
optimization, with a focus on dynamic programming languages, JIT compilers
and type analysis.
