BENEFITS =
Learning about garbage collection and particularly about D's
implementation. Discovering an alternative GC for (soft) real-time or
low-latency applications.

ABSTRACT =
Stop-the-world garbage collectors can be quite problematic for (soft)
real-time applications. The pauses introduced can be disruptive to the
point to make some applications inviable, like games or even low-latency
servers.

$(P The Concurrent D Garbage Collector (CDGC) was developed mainly to
address this issue, by making the mark phase run in parallel with the
actual application, reducing the pause times by 2 orders of magnitude.
Since our systems at sociomantic labs GmbH require to have very low
latency at all times, we've been using this collector for almost 2 years
now with good results.)

$(P This presentation gives a brief introduction to garbage collection,
describes original D's GC implementation details and explains how it has
been extended to do perform the mark phase in parallel. After showing
some benchmark results, shortcomings and future work and improvements
are discussed.)

BIO =
Leandro Lucarella has been following D since about 2004 and started
participating in D forums in late 2006. In 2008 he started working on
the CDGC as his Software Engineering thesis, which he finished by the
end of 2010. Since he got involved with D he has been a small but steady
contributor. With more than 12 years of experience in the industry, in
the last years he's been focusing on low-latency and distributed systems
in C/C++ and moved to Berlin in late 2011 to work at sociomantic labs
GmbH, a company using D as the main programming language.
