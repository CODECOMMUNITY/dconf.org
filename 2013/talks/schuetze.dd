BENEFITS =
Learning how to create custom type information using the RTInfo
compiler hook, understanding the gains and pitfalls of using precise
garbage collection in a systems programming language.

ABSTRACT =
$(P Though optional to some extent, garbage collection simplifies
programming considerably and is a major building block for a number of
features of the D programming language like slices and delegate
closures. The current garbage collector implemented in the D runtime
library is conservative, limiting the possibility to detect false
pointer references leading to unused memory leaking and polluting the
address space, especially in 32-bit environments.)

$(P This presentation describes the implementation of a precise
garbage collector for D that takes advantage of building necessary
type information at compile time via the existing RTInfo compiler
hook. Modifications to the D runtime library are discussed and
compiler modifications are proposed to support precise scanning the
data and TLS segments in addition to heap allocated memory.)

BIO =
Rainer Schuetze is the author of Visual D, an extension to Visual
Studio to integrate the D programming language. In addition he has
been working on improving the experience of debugging D applications
under Windows. In his professional career he has been working as a
software engineer in the computer music industry for almost 20 years.
