BIO =
I started to learn C++ in 2009 when I worked as DSP and application
developer at Ableton.  Two years later I was lucky enough to delve
into D.  Contributing to dmd and druntime has accompanied my discovery
of programming since then.  I still look forward to finish my studies
of electrical engineering and I'm an Emacser.
