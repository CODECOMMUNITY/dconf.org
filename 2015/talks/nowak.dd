ABSTRACT =
This talk will take an in-depth look at the state of D's garbage
collector. We will compare GC with other techniques, learn about
recent performance improvements in D's GC, profile and tweak the GC
for a specific application, see an example of manual memory
management, and have an outlook on upcoming GC improvements.

$(P D's garbage collector is notoriously known for being slow. This talk
will debunk some myths about garbage collection and will provide a
factual comparison of garbage collection against other memory
management techniques.)

$(P We will then look at specific reasons that make D's GC slow and review
how the recent improvements made it faster.)

$(P Following an introduction to the new GC profile and configure options,
we will tweak a small example application and have a brief look at
manual memory management.)

$(P The talk will finish with an outlook on ongoing GC improvements.)
